\usage{
plotObserved(
  data,
  SE = T,
  pch = NULL,
  col = NULL,
  xlab = NULL,
  ylab = NULL,
  main = NULL,
  env = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame in the format required by \code{\link[=LCA]{LCA()}}, with columns
\code{cross}, \code{mean}, \code{SE}, \code{sex}, \code{enviro}, \code{sire}, and \code{dam}.}

\item{SE}{Logical. Whether to include standard error bars. Default is
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{pch}{Integer or character. Plotting symbol for observed means. If
shorter than the number of cohorts, it will be recycled. Default is \code{16}.}

\item{col}{Character. Color for plotting symbols. If shorter than the
number of cohorts, it will be recycled. Default is \code{"black"}.}

\item{xlab}{Character. Label for the X-axis. Default is
\code{"\% P1 Genome"}.}

\item{ylab}{Character. Label for the Y-axis. Default is
\code{"Phenotype Measure"}.}

\item{main}{Character. Main title for the plot. Default is \code{NULL} (no
title).}

\item{env}{Logical. Whether an environmental effect is present in the
data. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Called for its side effect of producing a plot. Returns \code{NULL}
invisibly.
}
\description{
Creates a traditional line cross analysis plot showing observed cohort
phenotype means as a function of percentage of parent 1 genome. Overlays
the expectation from a simple additive model as a dashed blue line.
Optionally includes standard error bars.

\code{\link[=LCA]{LCA()}} for performing the analysis, \code{\link[=plot.genarch]{plot.genarch()}} for
plotting model-averaged results.
