Description: Implements an information-theoretic approach to the analysis of
    line cross data providing model averaged results of parameter estimates
    and unconditional standard errors. Uses AICc-based model selection to
    explore all possible models of composite genetic effects contributing to
    variation among generation means. Also includes functions to visualize
    model space, produce custom plots of multi-model inference results, and
    traditional line cross analysis plots.
